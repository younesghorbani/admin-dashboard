## Challenges

There were no significant challenges while doing this project. But it is worth mentioning that if you use the 'img' tag to display an SVG image, you will not be able to change its properties (here its color). This is what I encountered while doing the project. Although I was aware of the mentioned point, I had initially used the 'img' tag to display SVG icons and I did not realize that by doing this I would lose my control over the properties of the SVG image. But after realizing that, I replaced the 'img' tags with 'svg' tags.
